## Overview
Welcome to the ML_Project_2024 repository, where we delve into the fascinating world of machine learning. This repository houses a semester project from a university course, focusing on implementing various classification and regression models to predict house prices and the number of rooms. With a dataset containing over 160,000 entries, we've explored the realms of AI algorithms to uncover insights and make accurate predictions about real estate.

## Project Details
In this project, we've ventured into the domain of artificial neural networks, decision trees, linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and more to build robust models that can effectively predict house prices and the number of rooms. Using Python as our primary coding language, we've utilized popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow to enhance our machine learning capabilities.
